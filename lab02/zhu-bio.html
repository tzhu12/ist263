    My name is Tinghan Zhu, a senior in Syracuse University. 
    I am a Information Management and Technology major interested in dealing with big data.
    My technical skills are: Proficient in Python, R,SQL; Entry level in Java and Matlab.
    I had 2 project experiences about data visualization in last semester, me and my teammates identified patterns and trends in large data sets.
    In my leisure time, I like playing basketball and watching TV shows. I have been quarantined for about 1 month in order to get back to China, my home country.
    I chose this course because I want to learn how to make a website.
