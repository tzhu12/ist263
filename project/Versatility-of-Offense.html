        <h2>What information is underneath the plot:</h2>
        <p>
            The column chart above is the distribution of shot types for each team. In our stereotypes, the Warriors are good at shooting while the Cavaliers like driving to the basket. Nonetheless, this chart illustrates the versatility of both teams’ offense in a much stronger sense of depth. For instance, floater is not a common type of finishing, but the Warriors use them extensively. Also, the Warriors’ off-ball layup and driving pull-up exceed the Cavaliers’ nearly doubled.  I discuss those two types together not without reason. On account of the threat from Steph, Kevin, and Klay, they can drive and pull up from anywhere on the half court, the other players could cut into the basket more freely. This tactical routine was the most unstoppable weapon of that Warrior team. Another specious stereotype has broken by this data is the Warriors is a better dunk team than the Cavaliers. The most surprising category in this plot is the comparison of catch and shoot, Cleveland exceeds Golden State about 100 attempts. Why is that? Because Lebron James likes to bailing out the ball to shooters such as JR Smith, Kevin Love, and Channing Frye when he attacks the rim. This play is the most unstoppable tactical routine of the Cavs. As a result, it is clear to see that both team set up their tactics around their best players.

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>
            Both team build tactics around their best players. The Dubs utilize their shooters range to create more space whether to shoot or pass to teammates. On the other hand, the Cavs play around Lebron, his decision is the weather wane for his crew.
