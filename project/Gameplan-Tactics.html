        <h2>What information is underneath the plot:</h2>
        <p>
            This plot is a distribution of shots attempted by position for each team. According to the visualization of this barplot, it is clear to see that the difference of those 2 teams. On both guard position, the Warriors made more attempts than the Cavaliers did. This phenomenon is predictable since the Warriors have Splash Brothers: Stephen and Klay. Once you have the best and the second best shooters in NBA history, the only thing is designing tactics to make them shoot as many as possible. 
On both forward positions, the Cavaliers made more attempts than the Warriors did. There is no doubt that Lebron James takes a great portion of the small forward position. For Kevin Durant, he sacrificed a lot for this team. Back in times in Oklahoma Thunders, he averaged about 20 attempts per game. However, in this team, he wanted to  Also, on power forward position, the starting player for Cavalier was Kevin Love, who shoots average 10-15 times per game. On the contrary, the Warrior’s starting power forward was Draymond Green, while his major duties were defense, passing to shooters and setting screens. He is not the type of the player who impacts the game by putting the ball into the basket. Though the Warrior’s had David West on the bench, who contributed great fire power when the splash brothers and Kevin Durant were not on the court, the amount of attempts on power forward position is still behind.  On center’s position, both team don’t create shot opportunities for their center because of smaller lineups.

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>

        <p>
            The Warrior’s tactic focus is slightly toward guards while the Cavaliers tactic focus is slightly to forwards.
