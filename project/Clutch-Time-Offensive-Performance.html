        <h2>What information is underneath the plot:</h2>
        <p>
            When the lights shine the brightest, which NBA players perform the best? Clutch time is defined as the last five minutes of a game when a team is leading or trailing by five points or fewer. While individual moments and shots can sway our perception of a player's success in clutch time, the numbers don't lie. I filtered players shot performance by extracting data from 4th quarter only. Because of the complexity of clutch time performance, I created a treemap to illustrate different components by this 3D visualization. The size of each rectangle represents how many shots attempted with number listed in it. The blue color represents shot accuracy: the higher the accuracy, 
the lighter the rectangle color. Vice versa, the lower the accuracy, the deeper the rectangle color. In the left bottom corner, Lebron James occupies a great portion. Moreover, compare to Stephen, Kyrie, and Klay, he has the lightest color, which represents higher accuracy. While Kevin Durant has a relatively high accuracy, even though he does not take a lot of shot attempts in clutch time, he is the second best player in fourth quarter between those two teams.

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>
            In the treemap, we can conclude that LeBron James is the best clutch time player 
with the most shot attempts and a relatively accuracy.
