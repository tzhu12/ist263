        <h2>What information is underneath the plot:</h2>
        <p>
            According to the visualization of this huge honeycomb fullcourt shot chart, there is a lucid distinction between these two players. Lebron James is arguably the best player in his generation. He describes how he makes decisions on the court: “I run pick-and-rolls. If they double, find shooters. If they have a hot guy, I'll trap. I play real basketball, not fake basketball.” Since he has the strongest body and the widest vision in the league, he always tries to attack the rim and looks for shooters wideopen. As a result, most of his shots are under the rim, as the plot shows, the frequency is higher than 150 rather than other areas. This procedure is proven to be the most efficient way to build a team around Lebron after so many years. It is not difficult to see why his teammates, such as JR Smith, Kevin Love, and Channing Frye, earn their salaries attribute to their shooting ability.

While Stephen Curry is unarguably the best shooter in NBA history, his playing style is all based on his incredible range and accuracy. In the plot, there are many spots are behind the 3-point line by inches, including some half-court shots. His shots location are so scattered because the Warriors designed many off-ball pick&roll calls for him and Klay, so he can catch the ball and shoot instead of hold the ball and get trapped by double team. Someone called the Warriors play style as motion offense, which is a more polylaminate way to break down defense, as they take the advantage of off-the-ball running and make space for other players to cut and get open shots under the rim.

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>
            Absolutely. Both team’s tactical styles are determined by their best players. The Cavaliers’ offense is commanded by Lebron James completely. The Warriors rely on Stephen’s incredible shooting to make more space for their motion offense.
