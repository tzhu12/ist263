        <h2>Background Story</h2>
        <p>
            Following their loss in 2016, the Warriors made a huge splash in free agency when they landed Kevin Durant and added to an already-talented roster.
            While the Cavaliers remained their core roster as the defending champion.They are two best teams in the league but their tactical style are very different. 
            It is widely considered that the Warriors are more skillful at shootings and the Cavaliers are more athletic so they attack the rim directly.  Is is real? Let‛‛s find out!
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
        <p> I wanted to create this website to demonstrate my data visualization project. This project analyzes the data of Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers’s performance in 2016-17 NBA regular season. At the same time, each plot has an explanatory  interpretation which accounts for what information or pattern is behind the plot. The amount of data available in today’s world because of technology advancements is seemingly unimaginable. Sports teams are able to use this available data to their advantage. I am interested in the game of basketball and being a basketball analyst is my dream job. Although basketball is too unpredictable to be analyzed, it would be more interesting if we tell a short story about basketball in a scientific approach. I supported the Cavaliers because of LeBron James. However, I am wondering what if I remove my emotions and provide a rational analysis between these 2 teams. Despite the fact that Cleveland Cavaliers overcame the 3-1  loss and won the title eventually, I do not want to compare their finals performance because the sample size is too small. Also, analyzing the regular season is more fair than looking at playoffs’ data because both teams played 82 games so they share similar playtime.(omitting overtimes). Therefore, I decided to use their regular season data. It would be more reasonable and comprehensive to compare those 2 great teams by visualizing their offense performances. </p>
    
        <h2>Motivation (Targeted Audience)</h2>

    
        <p>My targeted audience are basketball fans who watch the NBA. They might be interested about this data visualization because it breaks down both teams‛ performance by 5 aspects: gameplan tactics, versatility of offense, superstar playing style, 3-pointer performance,  and clutch time offensive performance.</p>
        
        <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
        <p>The dataset is merged from 2 datasets downloaded on Kaggle. After cleaning up,there are 13394 shot attempts data as rows and their 14 characteristics as columns. Those characteristics include what the player position is, whether the game is a home game or not, where the shot was attempted, what is the name of home team, what type of the shot is, how many points the shot attempted, what is the name of away team, when the shot was attempted, when the date of game was, who shot the attempt, which quarter the shot attempted, and whether the shot was successful or not.</p>
